# portfolio-site

A responsive personal portfolio site that showcases my web development skills and projects. Created with Vite, Vitest, Tailwind CSS, &amp; Google Fonts.

## About

This is a responsive personal portfolio site that showcases my web development skills and projects. I created this site as part of the final project in the advanced HTML/CSS course for The Odin Project, a free online curriculum for learning web development. The site features a header with a photo and a navigation menu, a section with an introduction and a brief bio, a section with a list of my projects and links to their live demos and GitHub repositories, and a section with my contact information.

## Features

- This site is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and responsive design techniques.
- Uses custom fonts from Google Fonts and icons from Devicon and Material Design Icons.
- The site has a modern and minimalist design with a dark theme and subtle animations.
- Uses semantic HTML elements and follows accessibility best practices.
